"""
This module contains comparison techniques that are the result of experimentation that
did not lead to a technique that works well.

The core ideas of these techniques have no foundation in statistics and are simply ideas
I had to address issues I found with other techniques. However, preliminary experiments
showed that these techniques did not work well. And for this reason, these techniques are
_only_ included for completeness, and should _not_ be used.
